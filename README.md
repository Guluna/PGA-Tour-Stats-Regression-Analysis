Question:
This project analyzes the impact of driving distance on overall golf performance using the 2020 PGA Tour Stats dataset from Kaggle, aiming to determine if longer drives correlate with lower scores. 

Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), it was identified that Green in Regulation (GIR) holds the strongest correlation with scoring average (-0.57), surpassing driving distance (-0.40) and Fairway in Regulation (FIR) (-0.26). 

An Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model yielded an  of 0.233, confirming that while driving distance is a statistically significant predictor, accuracy metrics like GIR are critical components of performance, with significant interaction effects observed between distance and green accuracy.
